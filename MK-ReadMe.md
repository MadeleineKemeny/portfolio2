#HOMEWORK-week10: Portfolio 2.0

##Portfolio 2.0
This version of my Week 1 homework (now at week10) is to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, and AJAX. I picked a Bootstrap template that incorporates a few more bells and whistles, courtesy of the folks at MIT. Do I understand all of what they've written? No, but I understand enough to know where the onclick events are, the validators necessary, the imported type libraries, how the modals and anchors operate, where to change the pre-programmed styles that I didn't like... enough to use this template to show my knowledge and to take a swing at manipulating the parts I'm less familiar with to do the job I need them to do.

##Portfolio 1.0
The older version of my portfolio was built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It was a sad, hot mess.

##Licensing & Gratitude
Thanks, MIT! And Travis.YML, Gulp, SCSS, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and the rest of the programming experts out there who made this polished template. Special thanks to my tutor, Isabel Arcones, and my course instructor, Phil Loy, who are up for medals based on their patience.
